# Context

This is an ERP application development framework written in Kotlin targeting a Spring Boot deployment.
It is part of a multi-module Maven project, but has no dependencies on other modules and can be compiled and tested standalone.

# Environment

The linting inside the cursor IDE is not reliable, so you need to run the compilation with `mvn clean compile -DskipTests` on the command shellto ensure the code is correct.

We are on a Windows machine with the command shell.
