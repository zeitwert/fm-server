# Context

This is an ERP application for real estate management, written in mixed Java/Kotlin targeting a Spring Boot deployment.
It is part of a multi-module Maven project, and has a dependency to the dddrive application development framework.
Via the local maven repo this module can be compiled and tested standalone (without the parent pom).

# Implementation Approach

Whenever you hit a roadblock during code generation that implies that you will need to change the design of the solution or the implementation approach, NEVER do it automatically.
Always ask for feedback - we need to think about changing the design together, there was a reason we decided on the current approach.

# Coding

Any new code must be written in Kotlin.

# Persistence

The application uses a PostgreSQL database for persistence, accessed via the jOOQ library.
The database schema is generated and maintained via flyway through the scripts in the src/main/resources/db directory.

# Environment

We are on a Windows machine with the command shell.

# Compilation and Linting

The linting inside the cursor IDE is not reliable, so you need to run the compilation to ensure the code is correct.

`mvn compile -DskipTests -nsu`

or even with full recompilation (VERY SLOW):

`mvn clean test-compile -DskipTests -nsu`
