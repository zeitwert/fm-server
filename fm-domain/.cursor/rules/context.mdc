# Context

This is an ERP application for real estate management, written in mixed Java/Kotlin targeting a Spring Boot deployment.
It is part of a multi-module Maven project, and has a dependency to the dddrive application development framework.
Via the local maven repo this module can be compiled and tested standalone (without the parent pom).

# Persistence

The application uses a PostgreSQL database for persistence, accessed via the jOOQ library.
The database schema is generated and maintained via flyway through the scripts in the src/main/resources/db directory.

# Environment

The linting inside the cursor IDE is not reliable, so you need to run the compilation with `mvn compile -DskipTests` on the windows command shell to ensure the code is correct.

We are on a Windows machine and you should be using the command shell.
