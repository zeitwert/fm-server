# Run Tests

After any change, you run the tests to ensure the changes are working as expected.
The tests can be run via `mvn` on the windows command shell.

## run all tests (before completing the task)

`mvn clean test -pl !fm-ui`

## run a selection or specific test file (WITH code generation)

`mvn clean test -Dtest=[test-name-pattern] -pl !fm-ui`

example:

`mvn clean test -Dtest=BuildingTest -pl !fm-ui`

## run a selection or specific test file (WITHOUT code generation when you already did it before)

`mvn surefire:test -Dtest=[test-name-pattern] -pl !fm-ui`

example:

`mvn surefire:test -Dtest=BuildingTest -pl !fm-ui`

# Run Build

Before terminating your task, check that the builds are still correctly done.

`mvn clean compile test-compile -DskipTests -pl !fm-ui`
