# Run Tests

After any *server* change, you run the tests to ensure the changes are working as expected.
The tests can be run via `mvn` on the windows command shell.

If you only changed the UI, you do not need to run the tests, we do not have any tests yet (except running the application).

## compilation

If you changed code, you need to compile the code before running the tests.

`mvn test-compile -DskipTests -pl !fm-ui -nsu`

## run tests as specific as possible to minimize resource consumption

Run one specific test (need to specify the module):

`mvn surefire:test -Dtest=HouseholdMemTest -pl fm-dddrive`

Run all tests in one specific module:

`mvn surefire:test -pl fm-dddrive`

Run all tests in all modules except the ui (never test UI, it does not work with maven):

`mvn surefire:test -pl !fm-ui`

Run all tests in all modules WITH recompilation (VERY SLOW):

`mvn clean test -pl !fm-ui -nsu`

# Run Build

Before terminating your task, check that the build still compiles correctly done (this is not necessary if you just ran all tests).

`mvn clean test-compile -DskipTests -pl !fm-ui -nsu`
